NOTE; ALL ENTITES CAN BE USED WITH KEY "material" FOR MATERIAL DEFINATION UNLESS
	OTHERWISE MENTIONED. USER CAN OVERRIDE THE DEFAULT MATERIALS OF AN ENTITY.

NOTE; DON'T GET BERSERK WITH THE PARTICLE EFFECTS. USE THEM WITH CARE, AS IT IS VERY EASY
	TO OVERFLOW THE ENGINE AND CAUSE THE WHOLE THING TO CRASH! MORE SELDOM THEY ARE,
	THE MORE AMAZING THEY LOOK AND THE BETTER FPS WE'LL GET.
	
			=========================
			 NEW ENTITIES IN QMB MOD
			=========================

===================
 ENTITY MATERIALS:
===================
To use set .material of the entity into following. The effects aren't
done yet!

MAT_FLESH       = 1    // flesh
MAT_METAL       = 2    // metal
MAT_STONE       = 3    // stone (same as 0, only with a value)
MAT_WOOD        = 4    // wood
MAT_GRASS       = 5    // grass
MAT_SNOW        = 6    // snow 
MAT_ICE         = 7    // ice
MAT_SOFT        = 8    // paper, furniture, etc.
MAT_GLASS       = 9    // window glass
MAT_ELECTRIC    = 10   // electric equipment
MAT_NULL        = 11   // plastic etc. (no effects)
MAT_CANMEAT     = 12   // both metal and flesh (Knights)
MAT_SLIME	= 13   // blue, slimy thing (Spawn)


=====================
 LEVEL ENCHACEMENTS:
=====================

qmb
---
	classname:	qmb_falldmg
	keys: 		--
	notes: 		Add this to the map to toggle on the QMB-maps-only level
			features, such as realistic falling damage (= falling height
 			based, can kill player). Checked in StartFrame. Add only
			one, as this thing counts as an entity!

func_blowaway
-------------
	classname:	func_blowaway
	keys:		health ***			// entity hitpoints
			dmg ***				// sets explosive damage
			treshold *** 			// sets health min dmg required to trigger (0-1)
			wait ***			// delay breaking after triggering
			count ***			// amount of particles (0-40)
			gib_mdl "path/filename.mdl"	// gib model
			noise "path/filename.wav"	// breaking sound
			message "string"		// message displayed when touched
	notes:		None of the variables is required. Can be targeted and can have
			targets. If using gib_mdl, the particle amount is halved for the sake
			of overflows. Default material is MAT_STONE. If no health is set the
			entity can only be blown by a trigger. Use treshold for rocket-blast
			only-alike things (triggers will still do the trick).

func_ladder
-----------
	classname:	func_ladder
	keys:		--
	notes:		Trigger field. To use it create one right in front of the ladder
			brush. The climbing sound refers to the material of the trigger
			field entity, not the brush. To climb it up just face it and
			use jump / swim down buttons. Default material is MAT_METAL.

func_rain
---------
	classname:	func_rain
	keys:		count ***			// larger number, less drops
			color ***			// raindrop colour (0 - 255)
			noise "path/filename.wav"	// the ambient sound (looping)
	notes:		Trigger field. The use bigger .count for large areas for sake of
			both the FPS and the particle amount. Still under development!
			Mixing large areas with this and the func_blowaway with high particle
			count is NOT A GOOD IDEA! Disabled in Deathmatch (just in case).

misc_decor
----------
	classname:	misc_decor
	keys:		file "path/filename.mdl"	// filename of main model
			submodel1 "path/filename.mdl"	// filename of the first submodel
			submodel2 "path/filename.mdl"	// filename of the second submodel
			noise "path/filename.wav"	// filename of ambient sound
			noisevol			// ambient sound volume (0 - 1)
			maxskins ***			// amount of animation skins
			maxframes ***			// amount of animation frames
			minframes ***			// start frame
			stone ***			// SOLID_NOT or SOLID_SLIDEBOX (0/1)
			health ***			// health
			gib_mdl "path/filename.mdl"	// filename of the gib model
			dmg ***				// explosion damage
	notes:		Submodels are separate, dynamic entities, so beware the entity
			limit and the mighty framerate God!

misc_decor_static
-----------------
	classname:	--
	keys:		file "path/filename.mdl"	// filename of main model
			noise "path/filename.wav"	// filename of ambient sound
			noisevol			// ambient sound volume (0 - 1)
	notes:		There is no need for submodels, so if you want multiple models
			just add another misc_static_decor with the same origin. All
			Quake's static model entities have been converted to use this
			entity in sake of progs.dat optimization and file-size.
