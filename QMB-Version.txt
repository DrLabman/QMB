QMB-Version (1.18)

	Min requirements:
A 3D card which supports GL_ARB_multitexturing (this is a MUST). voodoo2's and better all support
it so, you would have to have a very old or crappy card to not have this.

I would recommend a PIII - 500 with Geforce 2, but it should work with lower specs. I use a
PIV - 2800 with Geforce 4 Ti 4200 and get about 200 fps.

	Bugs:
No player colours.

	Avi capture code notes:
you will need to set the host frame rate. 15, 20 and 30 all work fine (set host_framerate to 0.0333333333 for 30 fps, or 1/X where X=the fps you want) you can use max_fps console cvar when doing a non demo capture so you can still control the game :)

	Removed cvars which no longer worked or were pointless
gl_ztrick
r_lightmap
r_fullbright
r_norefresh
gl_texsort
gl_playermip
gl_reporttjunctions
gl_smoothmodels
	Removed command
Envmap

Fixed gib md3's do leave a blood trail
Fixed pickup md3's to bob and rotate
Changed the deathknight's range attack to leave a trail of yellow sparks insted of yellow blood
Added Quad shells to md3's so they are the same as mdl's
Changed quad texture to be blue
Added neural network code for use in bot

Uped max particles to 16384 but default amount is still 8192
Tweaked smoke particle alpha
Fixed some issues which appared in the 2 texture unit pipeline
Added modelflashing to md3 so that replacement pickup models can flash like bsp models can, uses model flag 256

	*-*Added in release 1.17 *-* 27 Feb 2005
Change default hud to white
Speed up loading with textures (non-24bit now back to original loading speed)
Larger QC runaway loop counter (1000000 insted of 100000)
Fixed up crosshair code, now loads any image in the /textures/crosshairs/ directory up to 32 of them
Fixed position of text on hud for fps and particle count.
Removed java vm
Redid bot code so they wander better when they can't see anyone, addes issues where they are attacking you and then turn around and wander off in the middle of a gun fight
Added 32bit texture loading for picture in a wad file from /textures/wad/ or /gfx/
Redid hud with 32bit textures from fuhquake and joequake
Uped max particle count to 8192 (doubled)
Used part of entars 'better fire' surgestion

	*-*Added in release 1.16 *-* 9 Aug 2004
Damn havn't been keeping this file upto date...
Added basic qc hud stuff.
Added a test spheremapping on models
Added png support
Fixed up some texture loading code
Fixed fullbrights so that it loads <texturename>_glow or <texturename>_luma
	Temp fix, <texturename>_glow was loading a diffrent map texture as a fullbright, _glow now disabled
Fixed lightning trail spawn bug, was spawning lots of lightning partilces insted of a beam
Added support for SGIS_generate_mipmap
Disabled cachedir stuff, not sure if we still need it
Replaced external texture finding code, should be faster (seems to be)
Added MD3 model loading
Fixed crosshairs, will load upto 32 crosshairs from /quake/qmb/textures/crosshairs/crosshair*.*
Added MD3 model interpolation
MD3 now uses vertex arrays to draw (for non interpolated frames)
Fixed TGA loading code is it is much faster.
Added JVM code.
Changed particle smoke to be gray.
Changed particle sparks to use textured quads.

*Java code changes:
Can view cvars and set cvars
Can print to console, centerprints, bprints and sprints
GloBot uses a java method to choose a name

	*-*Added in release 1.15
QMB should now support any sized image which the driver supports
Fixed the image loading so that images that dont need scaling (any image which is a power or 2, 2x2, 128x64, etc) doesnt use the scale array allowing for bigger textures.
Changed mipmap generation from quakes defualt to the GLU's function... (could be slower...)
Changed quakes rescaling texture function to GLU's function... (could also be slower...might be continuous memory reallocation should add back small buffer)
Fixed bug in the particle array trashing the heap.
Removed smoothmodels, it didnt result in any speedup on current hardware.
Removed other verious cvars
Added gl_quick_texture_reload (defualts to on) doesnt bother reloading a texture on map change if its already in memory (NOTE: maps with same textures names but diffrent textures will get the first loaded texture)
Added gl_24bitmaptex (defualts to on) this turns on/off loading 24bit textures for maps
ATI truform support
Added fullbrights as well as glow/luma support (needs 32bit tgas to work right, doesnt support colourmap tgas yet)
	*-*Fixed after initial release
Added gl_smoketrail to enable or disable the HL style smoke trail 0 - particles only, 1 - HL trail only, 2 - both
Added gl_ammoflash to enable the unreal style ammo box flashing
Readded the caustics picture to the zip

	*-*Added in release 1.14
Fixed detail texture cooard generation.
Fixed up the bots, the dont run into stuff as much, they still straf into it tho.
Coop bots now work
Added faded edges to the menus
Added hud_alpha to control the huds alpha
Fixed gamma (not hardware, could be a framerate killer for ppl who are fillrate limited)
Console colour, use &cRGB where R,G and B are numbers from 0 to 9 to change to a colour and &c to reset.
Added cel shading (based on a tute at nehe not off the qsg one)
Added vertex shading (based on the cel shading)
Added map outline (use with cel shading for the best effect)
Added the ability to turn of model textures to see the shading.

	*-*Added in release 1.13
Fixed the lighting on bmodels. Added glow thingo,
Rearranged rendering code some more for extra speed, and readability.
All brush models goes through the new code. Fixed some bugs with detail texture drawing.
Removed the -lm_* command line switches only rgb lightmaps supported internally
(Note:- it will still load normal white lightmaps)
Removed alot of pointless non-working cvars
Added Vertex lighting mode (by request)
Re-enabled max_fps cvar (not sure y it was commented out...)
Alias model colour fix thanx to Lord Havoc as well as model shell interpolation.

Finally got around to documenting the fact that skybox loading exists.
Have sky textures and r_skydetail 1 to make it work.
Sky textures go gfx/env/ with the name 'bkgtst??" where ?? is the rt, bk etc...

	*-*Added in release 1.12
Added model shells like the Q3A quad effect on players (currently not used for that yet)
Added md2 support, will be able to replace mdl with it
Fixed bmodels so that non lightmapped ones are now lit
Redid the map rendering code, it now texture sorts then draws, extra speed from that.

Known bug: Player skins dont get colours. I'm in the middle of replaceing the way that skins
get coloured, and so its not working right atm.
Known bug: Player skins tend to end up in strange places, this is to do with the way
that player skins were coloured before.

	*-*Added in release 1.11
JPEG texture loading.
gl_ztrick removed (only worked well for voodoo 1's)
Renderer speedups and clean ups
Water warp gone compleatly
Multitexturing detail textures (on geforce3/4 (non mx) and radeons)
Multitexturing sky (speedup)
Fixed up some hud code, and added hud_red, hud_green, hud_blue to customize the hud colour.
Added sv_fastswitch to allow for fast weapon switching (still needs qc work)
	***Fast weapon switching is coming***
More work on checkextions, and added support for most of the DP's extenions.
	None actuall supported yet... code is done for alot of them...


	*-*Added in release 1.10
Changed over to my new particle system. (looks similar but will make it easier to customise)
Added extra builtins
	PF_sin
	PF_cos
	PF_sqrt
Implemented lordhavoc's checkextensions for qc (i think)
Changed numbering system.

	*-*Added in release 1.00.09
Added Bots.
Fixed a bug where the bot kepted changing between best 2 weapons.
Updated list of metel/glass textures.
New movetype ladder.
Added 32 Bot support. (major packet overflow issues when alive and 31 bots)
Added more bot names.
Added a bot respawn delay (fix for maps with a limited amount of spawn spots)
Gl_ztrick defualts to 0 (most new 3dcards lose little if any speed to deaph buffer clearing)
no stencil buffer and 16bit defualt on 3dfx cards
show_fps also effects number of particles text
Added caustics, shiny texture and show_fps to the video menu.
New blood texture.

Currently needs fixing:
With alot of clients will cause packet overflows.
(i dont think it crashes but still packet overflows).
Bots are dumb. (i did mean to fix this in this release but next one hopefully)
DO NOT USE -nomod IT WILL CRASH :)
Added -nomod to allow qmb to be ran as a server not using the qmb mod progs.dat

note to self: i should cleanup gl_rpart.c its getting complex.

	*-*Added in release 1.00.08
Added .lit support (finally) - this also fixed some coloured lighting on models
Fixed a bug causing the splashing when entities moved from solid to empty
Added a -nostencil to allow cards without hardware support to get a speedup
Fixed some more lighting bugs and made overbrigt lighting only apply to dynamic lights
Bug: tried to fix the fire particles but stuffed them more

	*-*Added in release 1.00.07
Added gl_checkleak to allow mappers to check a map for leaks, by setting gl_clear to 1 and the colour to red
Added skyboxes (arnt used yet)
Added the qmb mod (being worked on by Necrophilissimo
Added stencil buffer shadows
Doubled max poly count for models (now 2048 verts and 4096 tris)
Added the model skin replacement naming which lordhavoc uses for darkplaces
	so now blah.mdl the external tga/pcx for skin0 should be called
	*blah_0.tga //tomaz way, first one looked for
	*blah.mdl_0.tga //lordhavoc way (note that a .pcx insted of .tga works for both)

Engine changes by Necrophilissimo

-Removed gamma, too much of a proformance hit, ill work out another way.
Removed video menu in the options menu, you couldn't use it anyway.
Console alpha value can be controled with gl_conalpha
Added dual layer water. Now multitextures so no proformance loss.
Shiny glass texture and metal texture, to replace reflections, sphere map style.
Quake3 style weapon bob.

Frame and model interpolation.
Coloured lighting now works on models :)
Detail textures (using the ones for tomaz engine tut fixed for normal quake)
