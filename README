Code was forked from Tomaz's Clean Quake. Changes made after the fork can be
found in 'QMB-Version.txt'.

Some code changes are from tutorials originally hosted on QuakeSrc.Org, I'm not
sure where you can find these tutorials any more but the inside3d.org forums
would be a good place to start.

GCC is used to compile this project. Tested on windows using MinGW and MSYS.
Also tested under Fedora Core 16.

The following libraries are required to build this project:
libpng
libjpeg
GLee
SDL
Opengl

This code was forked to at version QMB 1.18 to become Vengeance R2 engine. At
the time (2012/02/16) of writing this README more information about vengeance r2
can be found at: http://entardev.wordpress.com/games/vengeance-r2/

I hope you enjoy the code as much as I enjoyed working on it :)
